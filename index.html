		<h4>Finally after couple months of being busy in real life, i have a time and reason to update this site<ul><li>Added "Skip to main content" button (press Tab+Enter, if that doesn't work, you probably clicked somewhere which changes the focused area. click the navigation pane and try again)</li><li>Remove unnesecary comments</li><li>Remove hidden "This Site Will Be My *New* Home On The Web" text (this website is actually made from a template, which as time goes on i customized things further, and also i feel that text is just a bit weird to put it lol)</li><li>Add robots.txt file (my signal to companies like Meta, Baidu, Bytedance, OpenAI, Google bots to not scrape my site)</li><li>Change "MDP" to "MDP43140" (too much MDP's out there lol)</li><li>Change header description</li><li>Fix go to top button</li><li>Copyright name is now clickable (redirects to my GitHub page)</li><li>Add current page on title</li><li>And other minor tweaks and changes.</li><li>(sadly) Remove hover effect on card (because it looks weird, adds up CSS complexity, and on Chromium-based browser the transition is lagging behind)</li><li>Use ul-li for bullet points (ul makes things wider but it looks nicer too so idk)</li><li>Changed fonts to Poppins (CDN using privacy-respecting Google Fonts alternative (proxy), maybe later switch to actual fast CDN)</li><li>CSS tweaks and fixes.</li><li>Move and rename image files properly.</li><li>Remove "section" element (replaced by main#main-content, and also its written in broken way)</li><li>Remove generic class from element (eg. header.header &gt; header)</li><li>Rename some links</li><li>And many more small changes</li></ul></h4>

		<h4>Polyfill[.]io is a free service that provides code that adds missing functions to older browsers, but out of nowhere it was suddenly bought by a Chinese company without any notification to developers that were using it, and now its literally malware that at specific time and browser will redirect to gambling sites. don't worry, its now removed from this site, plus i blocked it in BaDomain NoMalware blocklist. <a href="https://techradar.com/pro/security/thousands-of-websites-told-to-ditch-polyfill-service-after-chinese-hackers-hijack-it-to-serve-malware">Read this article from TechRadar for more details</a></h4>

		<h4>My GitHub account got flagged for no reason, it happened when I'm failed to login GitHub Desktop multiple times (due to an unknown bug that changes login URL, i had to dig up the log to get actual URL, shame that no one had any solutions at all), couple months later i migrated to ProtonMail, couple weeks later i commited some changes just like usual But GitHub desktop complaining that it cant push the commit, i tried login again, but it said that my account was not exist, thinking that i probably get hacked, i check my email and i got an email from GitHub to force-reset my password, i did that and make sure no devices are hacked (which in this case there wasn't any devices hacked) One week later i tried commiting again on GitHub Desktop for my BaDomain project, but i realized that i cant access my repos, i tried logging in, everything looks okay as usual, until i realized that GitHub now flagged my account I dont know what caused this to happen, i did nothing wrong, I tried finding solutions, including contacting GitHub support for account reinstatement request, To this day (7 days since the reinstatement request was made),<br>GitHub staff is still not responding to my request.<br><br>Update: the fact that you can see this webpage again means GitHub staff unbanned my account finally</h4>
